    3. nose / nose2 
    
__unittest__
    
Unittest comes as a builtin library with in python. Inorder to write unit tests using this framework we will have to write test case with in a class, and that class has to inherit _TetsCase_ class. In order to do the assertion we have to use the assert methods from the TestCase class of unittest module.
    
__pytest__
        
Pytest is an external library that has to be installed using pip. We can write test cases either with in class or as direct methods without any classes. It uses the default assert statament that comes as part of python.
